# Click To Minimize
Runescape is great to afk. This helps make it even more great to do so.

For certain actions, all you need is a single click and then to alt tab back to whatever it was you were doing. This takes 50% of the work out of the process, by minimizing the client on clicking certain actions.

They can be specified in the config like so:

Pick-Fruit: Sq'irk tree, Mine: Crashed Star

When the client detects you clicked using those actions, it'll minimize immediately. This is really handing when you have runelite "Force" the game focus back on screen for idle notifications.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Sending me a message on discord is the best way to reach out, "ani_why_force_this"
